# TruckPlan

This following exercise is intended to help aid discussion - there are no wrong answers. You will  have to make assumptions to complete the implementation. Please document your assumptions. 
Please limit the scope to about 2 hours (we’re not looking for a full solution – it’s up to you where  you put the focus) and implemented in C#. Document what you have left out of the scope. 
Domain 
A Truck Plan describes a single driver driving a truck for a continuous period. For example; a five hour drive through Germany on a specific date. A driver is a person with a name, birthdate, etc. 
Each truck has a GPS device installed. This device provides the system with the current truck  position approximately every 5 minutes. 
1. Design and implement a model for representing the domain. 
2. Implement functionality to calculate the approximate distance driven for a single TruckPlan. 
3. Find a way to get the country from a coordinate. A solution could, for example, be to call an  external web service. 
4. Implement functionality for answering the following question: "How many kilometers did  drivers over the age of 50 drive in Germany in February 2018?" 
We look forward to discussing your solution to this exercise! 
Please send us the solution in advance of the interview so we can set it up for your arrival.
